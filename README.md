## About Term Project

**Prepare a report with RMarkdown in RStudio by selecting a data set
(any data set).**

-   Term project will be the analysis of a data set you choose.

-   The data set can be an existing data or you can collect data by
    conducting a survey. If you choose to conduct your own survey please
    make sure that you ask the appropriate questions to collect
    different types of data.

-   You can choose the data according to your interests or you can use
    the data you used in other courses.

-   The purpose of the term project is to apply the techniques we
    learned in the class.

-   The aim of the project is not to perform a detailed analysis.
    Therefore, you do not need to calculate every statistics or plot
    every possible graph for each variable.

-   The aim of the project should be to ask meaningful questions about
    the data set you have and to provide meaningful answers to these
    questions with data analysis.

-   You do not need to apply all the statistical methods we learned in
    the class. If you want, you can also use the methods that we did not
    cover.

-   It is also useful to discuss the shortcomings of the methods you use
    and how one can improve the analysis.

-   You should discuss the reliability and validity issues related to
    your data and the appropriateness of the statistical analysis to
    this data.

-   Do not visualize all of your data with a single graph. You need to
    create various graphs with your data.

-   Do not forget that a single well-prepared graph with attention to
    detail is better than a lot of poorly prepared graphs.

-   It doesn’t matter which additional packages you use, but you must
    use the `tidyverse` packages.

-   Pay attention to spelling rules as much as possible. [The Elements
    of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style) is a
    great book and I highly recommend you to obtain a copy of this book.
    This will be a great reference guide in your professional life.

-   All analysis must be done in RStudio.

## Data

-   To be successful in the project, it is important that the data set
    is relatively small but the data is easily accessible and large
    enough to explore multiple relationships.

-   **It is recommended that you have at least 50 observations and 10 to
    20 variables in your data set.**

-   **It is recommended that the data set includes categorical
    variables, discrete numeric variables and continuous numeric
    variables.**

-   Do not reuse the data sets used in the examples or assignments in
    the class.

-   If you are having problems, seek help before it is too late.

-   **I will not accept any data you find on [Kaggle
    datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)**

## Important Dates

**Project Proposal and Final Project submisson will be done by uploading
a zip file to the ekampus system along with the Github repo link. If you
do not upload a zip file to the system and do not provide a Github repo
link, you will be deemed not to have entered the midterm and final
exams.**

**Your Make-Up Exam will be in the form of both a Project Proposal
(Project) submission and an additional Exam.**

1.  **Proposal Due:** 16 April 2023, 23:59
2.  **Project Due:** TBA

## Project Proposal

-   **You must upload your project folder (`YourStudentID.zip` file) to
    *ekampus.ankara.edu.tr* until 16 April 2023.**

-   You are expected to add the data set you plan to use into the
    `/data/` folder.

-   You are expected to add the bibliographic information of the
    literature you plan to use into the `biblio.bib` file.

-   In your project proposal, you are expected to explain your data
    analysis plan and data set.

-   Your project proposal should be the introduction section of your
    project. You can continue to make changes to the introduction
    section until the final submission of the project, ie the end of the
    term.

-   **Section 1 - Introduction:** In this part, you are expected to
    explain the following points.

    -   Your research question and where & how you found the data set,

    -   Observations, variables, etc. included in the data.

    -   Literature relevant to your research question. Briefly discuss
        the articles (the word article refers to **academic** articles,
        not blog posts, not reddit posts, not newspaper articles but
        **academic** articles that are published in academic journals)
        you read by giving reference. **Do not summarize each article
        individually under a separate title.** It is expected that you
        cite at least six articles in the literature review.

## Project

-   **You must upload the final version of your project
    (`YourStudentID.zip` file) to *ekampus.ankara.edu.tr* until TBA.**

-   In the final form of your project, you are expected to finish the
    analysis that you promised in your proposal.

    -   **Section 2 - Data:** Summarize the content of your data with a
        summary statistics table and provide information about the
        variables included in the data.

    -   **Section 3 - Methods and Data Analysis:**

        -   Provide information about the outcome (dependent, *Y*)
            variable and predictive (explanatory, *X*) variables that
            you will use to answer your research question.

        -   Provide information about the comparison groups you will
            use, if any.

        -   Perform a preliminary data analysis, including some summary
            statistics and visualizations (graphs), as well as some
            explanations to help you learn more about your data.

        -   Provide information about the method(s) that you believe
            will be useful in answering your questions.

        -   Provide information about the results of the methods you
            used (eg regression results if you have used regression
            analysis) and add the necessary tables.

    -   **Section 4 - Conclusion:** Summarize the results of your
        analysis. Discuss to what extent your results responded to the
        research question you identified at the beginning and how this
        work could be improved in the future.

-   You are expected to write a one-page summary of your final project.
    This summary should provide information about the data set you used,
    your research questions, methodology, and findings.

-   The summary is worth 10 points, it will be evaluated according to
    whether it follows the guidance given above and whether it is
    concise but detailed.

-   **Each section should not be more than 2 pages (excluding
    references, tables and figures).**

-   **All results presented in the project must be derived with the `R`
    code.** The answers/results given without the `R` code will be
    considered incomplete. If you perform calculations manually instead
    of using `R` and then report results from those calculations, you
    will not be able to receive points for them. All code reported in
    your final project document should work properly. Please do not
    include any code that causes error messages or is not related to
    analysis.
